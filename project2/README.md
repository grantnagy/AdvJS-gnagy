# Project 2
For project 2 I created a slot machine game.
This project is hosted on my website [here.](https://grantnagy.github.io/pr2.html)
This project utilizes html, css, bootstrap 4.0.0, javascript, and jQuery.

## Rules of the Game  
To start, you get 10 credits.  
Each spin costs 1 credit.  
Click spin to spin once.
To win, get three like values. A win is 10 credits.  
To push, get two like values next to each other.  
Easter Egg: Get three '3's and win 333 credits.  
Values range from 1 to 5.  
Below the buttons it will notify you of a win, loss, or empty credits.  
If you run out of credits, you must click the reset button. You may reset whenever.
